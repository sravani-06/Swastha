**Prediction of Heart Diseases and Continuous Health Monitoring**

Constant monitoring and early detection of chronic diseases are important to avoid the risk related to this kind of disease. This is the motivation behind developing a system that regularly monitors the health condition of patients and giving proper medical care to them at the right time. Knowing the body and the symptoms that the heart is getting worse will help people stay healthier and out of the hospital. 


**Problem Statement**
The problem is regular health monitoring for a patient in a remote area or for a working professional might be difficult because they canâ€™t visit hospitals regularly for various reasons like travel and lack of time

**Solution Approach** 
The increasing acceptance of wearable devices in recent years leads to the fact that a varied range of physiological and functional data are captured continuously by these devices which can be used for real time health monitoring by using these wearable devices. With the help of technology, a wearable device is used for health monitoring using a RNN with LSTM based system. This system will monitor using features extracted from wearable sensors, these wearable products will be a motion sensor. The system will classify a patient condition and inform the patient about their health status. So this system can reduce the risk of unprecedented heart attacks and improves the health monitoring status of a person.
